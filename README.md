#1 
  1) O(1) - Constant - One operation
  2) O(n) - Linear - Like looping over a single array.  Number of operations equals the input size.

#2 - O(1) - Constant - Only ever one operation

#3 - O(n^2) - Polynomial Time - Nested arrays

#4 - O(n) - Linear - Single loop on an array

#5 - O(n) - Linear - It has to evaluate each item of the array so runtime increases linearly with the size of the array.

#6 - O(n^2) - Polynomial Time - It's a nested loop.

#7 - The algorithm is pushing the fibonacci sequence to an array. O(n) - Linear.  It is going to run approximately one operation per size of the array.

#8 - O(log(n)) - As the data set grows it doesn't increase linearly because we also eliminate more options with each operation even though you have more to operate on to begin with.

#9 - O(1) - No matter how long your array is you will only ever find one element and do approximately one operation.

#10 - This algorithm is checking whether n is a prime number.  O(n) - It is linear because as n gets bigger the number of operations grows proportionally. 

#11 -
